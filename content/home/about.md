# About Me
I am a PhD candidate at [CVIT](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/), [IIIT Hyderabad](http://iiit.ac.in/), working under the supervision of [Prof. C.V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/). My doctoral research focuses on the problem of information retrieval from scanned handwritten and printed document image collections. 

I am currently a recipient of Alexa Graduate Fellowship (2018-2019). Previously I was a TCS research fellow.
